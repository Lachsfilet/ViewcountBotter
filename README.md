# Help / How can I get a Link (Step 1)

First you want to create a profile overview already done?
You may skip this step go to step 2!

First create a Repository Called ${Your_Profile_Name} create it with a readme.md (set it to public).
Now go to **[Profile Markdown Generator](https://rahuldkjain.github.io/gh-profile-readme-generator/)** and fill it out.
before you click generate readme you need to check the 'display visitor count badge' option at the addons tab. 
I recommend checking 'display top skills' and 'github profile' stat cards as well.
Create your readme, copy the given readme and go back to github you now want to edit your readme in the ${Your_Profile_Name} paste the content, save it.

# Step 2 Retrieving the Link
Go to your github site.
Click on the Profile views button and copy the URL you are now set paste the URL into the script.
